# Veterinary Clinic Register

This is a serverless Django project for the final Hackathon organized by HackBulgaria's "Programming with Python 101" course.

# Project information

The project is a website that allows people to register accounts and login with them. From there on they can add, edit and delete information about each of their pets and when an incident occurs they can immediately register a procedure. The information for the procedures can also be edited and deleted. That way the clinic will know how to prepare while you travel with your pet on your way to them.
# Setup

Download the repository and start it with ```python manage.py runserver```. Then open your localhost and from there on you can start adding pets and procedures.
